Start

Import the 'os' module for file existence checking.

Function file_exists(filename):
    Return True if the file with the given filename exists, otherwise, return False.

Function read_file(filename):
    Create an empty list called 'numbers'.
    If file_exists(filename):
        Open the file with the given filename for reading.
        For each line in the file:
            Split the line into individual numbers.
            Convert each number to an integer and add it to the 'numbers' list.
        Close the file.
    Else:
        Print an error message indicating that the file was not found.
    Return the 'numbers' list.

Function filter_odd_or_even(numbers, keep_odd):
    Create an empty list called 'filtered_numbers'.
    For each number in 'numbers':
        If 'keep_odd' is True and the number is odd (num % 2 == 1):
            Add the number to 'filtered_numbers'.
        If 'keep_odd' is False and the number is even (num % 2 == 0):
            Add the number to 'filtered_numbers'.
    Return the 'filtered_numbers' list.

Function reversed_bubble_sort(numbers):
    Get the length 'n' of the 'numbers' list.
    For 'i' in the range from 0 to 'n':
        For 'j' in the range from 0 to 'n - i - 1':
            If 'numbers[j]' is less than 'numbers[j + 1]':
                Swap 'numbers[j]' and 'numbers[j + 1]'.

Function main():
    Import the 'sys' module.
    Check the number of command-line arguments:
        If there are not exactly 3 arguments:
            Print a usage message and exit.
    Get the first command-line argument as 'Lab2_5_1'.
    Get the second command-line argument as 'Lab2_5_2'.
    Filter odd numbers from the result of read_file(Lab2_5_1) and store them in 'odd_numbers'.
    Filter even numbers from the result of read_file(Lab2_5_2) and store them in 'even_numbers'.
    Combine 'odd_numbers' and 'even_numbers' into 'combined_numbers'.
    Sort 'combined_numbers' in reverse order using reversed_bubble_sort.
    Print 'combined_numbers'.

Call the main() function to start the program.
